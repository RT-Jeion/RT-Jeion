#  Hi, I'm RT Jeion. 
## Aspiring to Be a AI Engineer 

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a dedicated learner and builder with a strong focus on **AI Engineering**, **Systems Design**, and **Mathematical Foundations** for intelligent systems.

---

## ðŸ”­ Current Focus

I'm currently building my skill set across three key domains:

- **Mathematics for Machine Learning** â€” Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and Optimization  
- **Python & ML Foundations** â€” Clean, production-ready code and real-world ML pipelines  
- **Systems Thinking** â€” Scalable architectures and infrastructure for AI-driven applications  

My goal is to grow from **Machine Learning Engineer** â†’ **AI Architect** â†’ **AI Researcher**, while building systems, not just solutions.
